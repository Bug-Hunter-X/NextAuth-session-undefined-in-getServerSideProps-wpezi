# NextAuth Session Undefined in getServerSideProps

This repository demonstrates a common issue when using NextAuth.js with getServerSideProps in Next.js 15: the session object is sometimes undefined even after successful login.

## Problem

The `About` page uses `getServerSideProps` to retrieve the user's session from NextAuth. However, under certain conditions, the `session` object within `getServerSideProps` remains undefined, despite the user being successfully logged in. This results in incorrect rendering of the page.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the `unstable_getServerSession` function receives the correct context and that NextAuth is correctly configured.  Additionally, proper error handling can gracefully manage cases where session retrieval fails.  The solution file provides a robust fix.
